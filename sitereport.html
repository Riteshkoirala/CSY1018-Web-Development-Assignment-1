           		(This is the general discussion between the student(Ritesh) and his school time teacher regarding the assignment as the student(Ritesh) has gone to show his work to him and get his response from it and improve it if needed.)<br><br>
           		Student: Hi sir, it has been long since we met.<br><br>
           	Teacher: For sure, and you said you have something to show to me and needed my suggestion for it.<br><br>
           		Student: yes, it is my assignment  work.<br><br>
           		Teacher: ok , first tell me something or share some of your expirences with me about your college life and and the things that you have learned and how hard or easy it was and the ups and downs that you have faced from the start.<br><br>
           		Student: The college life is really awesome and have included many awesome people in the group. It's going on very well and what do you actually mean by up's and down?<br><br>
           		Teacher: I mean, you surely have learned many new things like programming and all. so, how was it ?<br><br>
           		Student: Oh programming, it is really the interesting part of study. Till now we have learned the programming language like HTML, CSS, JS. In which JS is the language that we just got started so, i am in the beginner level and about HTML, it is the one i started studying when i was in class 10 so, while getting started here i did not got much problem with it. And CSS was like completely new because of which I got many problem during the learning process.<br><br>
           		Teacher: Ok, then who was the teacher and how's the module going on till now.<br><br>
           		Student: His name is Ankit Thapa and from the beginning he was very helpful. this module was tough though because the programming language like css was completely new in which i got stuck many time but ankit sir use to solve the each and every problem by focusing on each student so I did not go through the vast pressure in this whole module.<br><br>
           		Teacher: Now, let's get into your assignment. But first explain the design decisions you made, how  you chose the font/color and sites which influenced your website design.<br><br>
           		Student: The design decision was like from the various youtude channel which i have seen exactly same on every youtube channel and the decision which might be quiet similar. Color and font, I have to say as going in the my mebsite which i got my eye on i kept them which makes looking the website attractive i hope and the background color is (#fff) and font is ('Montserrat', sans-serif). The website that i got influenced from is <a href="https://www.sharesansar.com/news-page">sharesansar page.</a>
           		And protfolio page was so confusing and i have done it by myself. and for the cv page this id the common format of writing cv which is used by mostly everyone and for contact page i looked various youtube channel which give same type of format which i tried here and for site report, is done by myself. <br><br>
           		Teacher: Is there any pages that you have done any change in the assignment?<br><br>
           		Student: yes, the protfolio page i changed the some of the layout decision in this because of the confusion with the placeholder image And i have the screenshot of the layout i have changed below;<br></P>
